### TODOs

* [X] Finish the run function, that does the computations nessary to pass from a state i to state i+1. Need to implement if/switch cases for every rules
* [X] Fix the neighbour count function, it's currently broken

## Notes

##### pass a 2D array to a function

```cpp
void processArr(int **a) {
   // Do Something
}
// When calling:
int **array;
array = new int *[10];
for(int i = 0; i <10; i++)
   array[i] = new int[10];
processArr(array);
```

##### instatiate objects in C++

The `new` operator returns a pointer to the object it creates, so the expression `Myclass object = new Myclass();` is invalid.

```cpp
Myclass *object = new Myclass(); //object has dynamic storage duration (usually is on the heap)
Myclass object; //object has automatic storage duration (usually is on the stack)
```
