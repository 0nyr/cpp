# Notes about Competitive Programming

compile: `g++ -o main main.cpp --ansi --pedantic -Wall --std=c++11`

## Tips

1. READ THE STATEMENT of the problem, at least 2 times ! Make sure to understand the examples. Also, note the possible errors you could make from now on while answering the question.
2. Try to get the stupidest & simplest solution first. THEN ONLY try to improve the algorithm.
